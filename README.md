# Library-Management-System

This is an innovative solution for libraries where a student can have full information related to the library including how many books are available, borrowed by other students, and estimated time for returning them.
In addition, it has a chat page where you can deliver your questions and suggestions needed for further improvement of the service or system. <br />

# Collaboration:

I look forward to collaborating with anyone who wishes to invent innovative solutions based on existing problems.
